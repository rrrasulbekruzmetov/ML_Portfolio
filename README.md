🌍 Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction
A Machine Learning project that predicts Air Quality Index (AQI) values based on real-world pollutant levels using regression models.
This project demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation with a focus on environmental health applications.

📌 What is AQI?
The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a standardized indicator that reports the air quality of a specific area.
It is calculated using the concentrations of major pollutants:

PM2.5 (Particulate Matter ≤ 2.5 µm)

PM10 (Particulate Matter ≤ 10 µm)

NO₂ (Nitrogen Dioxide)

SO₂ (Sulfur Dioxide)

CO (Carbon Monoxide)

O₃ (Ozone)

AQI values indicate the potential health impact of air pollution:

AQI Category	Range
✅ Good	0 – 50
🟡 Moderate	51 – 100
🟠 Unhealthy	101 – 150
🔴 Unhealthy for Sensitive	151 – 200
☠️ Hazardous	201+

🎯 Project Objective
To build a regression model capable of accurately predicting AQI values from pollutant measurements, enabling:

📢 Early warnings for public health

🌱 Environmental monitoring

🏛 Government & industrial policy planning

🔍 Approach & Workflow
1️⃣ Data Loading & Cleaning
Load dataset: AirQualityUCI.csv

Handle missing values and select relevant pollutant features.

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize pollutant distributions & AQI range.

Compute correlation matrix to identify key predictors.

3️⃣ Feature Selection & Engineering
Select pollutant variables as model features.

Optional: Create derived features (e.g., pollutant ratios).

4️⃣ Model Training
Train/Test split.

Model: Random Forest Regressor.

5️⃣ Model Evaluation
Metrics used:

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

R² Score (explained variance)

📊 Visualization: Actual vs Predicted AQI scatter plot for performance check.

📈 Results & Insights
R² Score: Shows how much of AQI variance is explained by pollutants.

Lower RMSE & MAE: Indicate stronger prediction accuracy.

EDA Observations: PM2.5 and PM10 have the strongest correlation with AQI.
